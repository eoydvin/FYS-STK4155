This is the repository for Project 1 in the course FYS-STK4155 at UiO. 

Known errors/future improvements:
- Splitting data into train and test groups should happen before I scale the data. MSE could then be estimated by transforming predicted values back to pre scaled data. 
- I scaled data by dividing by its mean value, this worked, but what I meant to do was to divide by its variance. This will be corrected in future projects:) 

This repo contains the following files:

Project report:
- Project_1.pdf: Report for project 1.

Python modules:
- franke_function.py: Returns z according to Franke's Function given x and y.
- regression.py: My own implementation of OLS and Ridge regression.
- nedborradar.py: My own class for downloading weather radar image for the Oslo region. 

Jupyter notebooks:
- Exercise 1: Plot of Franke's Function, some tests that my own implementations behaves as expected. 
- Exercise 2: Bootstrap on Franke's Function using OLS. Comparison of analytical and estimated variance in beta values. 
- Exercise 3: CV on Franke's Function using OLS. 
- Exercise 4: CV and Bootstrap on Franke's Function using Ridge regression.
- Exercise 5: CV and Bootstrap on Franke's Function using Lasso regression. 
- Exercise 6: CV on weather radar image using OLS, Ridge and Lasso regression.
- Exercise 6_random_sampling: Variant of Exercise 6 where I draw random samples from image instead of reducing the resolution with blurring. 

Numpy file:
- nedbor_radar.npy: Example weather radar image from an weather event at 2021-10-06 kl 11:45.
